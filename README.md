# material-weather
SPA showcasing Weather and Forecast from different cities. This assignment is made to present at Backbase.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.9.

## TODO List

* Implement UT
* Implement E2E Test

# Requirements - Exercise

"We will use Open Weather Data to create a single page application that presents a list of 5 European cities (you
can choose the ones you prefer).
Your goal is to get the current weather situation displaying the city name plus average temperature and the wind
strength. Clicking on an item shows the forecast in the next hours.
You can adjust the UI how you see fit for the best result but sticking to a single page application is mandatory.
We would prefer if you will deliver the code using BitBucket (private repo) but also a zip file is fine.""
